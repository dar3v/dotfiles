# Declare a passthrough mode. This mode has only a single mapping to return to
# normal mode. This makes it useful for testing a nested wayland compositor

# Various media key mapping examples for both normal and locked mode which do
# not have a modifier

# Set background and border color

# Set keyboard repeat rate

# Make all views with an app-id that starts with "float" and title "foo" start floating.

# Make all views with app-id "bar" and any title use client-side decorations

# Set the default layout generator to be rivertile and start it.
# River will send the process group of the init executable SIGTERM on exit.
